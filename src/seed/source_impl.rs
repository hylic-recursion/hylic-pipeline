//! SeedPipeline impls both source traits:
//! - `TreeishSource`: fuses (grow, seeds_from_node) into a treeish
//!   over N at yield time; the caller receives the 2-slot pair.
//! - `SeedSource`: extends with the 3-slot yield that includes the
//!   pipeline's stored `grow` closure, enabling SeedLift composition.
